"""SecureCorp is a large enterprise with multiple subsidiaries and business units located
across different geographical regions. As part of their digital transformation initiative,
the IT team at SecureCorp has been tasked with building a secure and scalable
communication system to enable seamless collaboration and information sharing
between their various subsystems.
The enterprise system consists of the following key subsystems:
1. Finance System (System A): Responsible for all financial record-keeping, accounting,
and reporting.
2. HR System (System B): Manages employee data, payroll, and personnel related
processes.
3. Supply Chain Management (System C): Coordinates the flow of goods, services, and
information across the organization's supply chain
These subsystems need to communicate securely and exchange critical documents, such
financial reports, employee contracts, and procurement orders, to ensure the enterprise's
overall efficiency.
The IT team at SecureCorp has identified the following requirements for the secure
communication and document signing solution:
1. Secure Communication: The subsystems must be able to establish secure
communication channels using a combination of RSA encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
2. Key Management: SecureCorp requires a robust key management system to generate,
distribute, and revoke keys as needed to maintain the security of the enterprise system.
3. Scalability: The solution must be designed to accommodate the addition of new
subsystems in the future as SecureCorp continues to grow and expand its operations.
Implement a Python program which incorporates the requirements."""
